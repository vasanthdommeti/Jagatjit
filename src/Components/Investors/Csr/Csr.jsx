            <p>
              JIL manages its operations in sustainable ways that protect the environment and preserve biodiversity. Each of our businesses is committed to meeting high standards of performance, and the company imposes exacting controls on all processes that have environmental implications. JIL’s business partners, suppliers and contractors are encouraged to attain similar high levels of green protocols. The company has installed a modern effluent treatment plant that converts the distillery effluent into valuable fuel for its boilers. The steam produced from the effluents is fed into a modern turbine to generate valuable clean power. Besides this, JIL has constructed several rain harvesting trenches throughout its premises to replenish the natural aquifer and for water conservation.
