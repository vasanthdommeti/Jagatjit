      <h2 class="heading">Social Responsibility</h2>
      <p>JIL’s business activities directly affect the lives of millions of people across the country, be it consumers, employees, investors or commercial partners. This brings a responsibility upon us to be a good corporate citizen, and ensure that all our stakeholders can benefit from the relationship.</p>
      <p>JIL focuses its efforts on being socially responsible, in areas where its impact is the greatest, and where it can make the most difference. The company’s belief is that for an enduring, successful business, helping employees reach their full potential and building communities that are stable and prosperous is paramount.</p>

      <h2 class="heading">Environment</h2>
      <p>As one of the world’s leading premium drinks businesses, JIL manages its operations in an environmentally sustainable way, that also supports biodiversity. Each of our businesses is committed to meeting high standards of performance and the company imposes exacting controls on all processes that have environmental implications. JIL’s business partners, suppliers and contractors are encouraged to have a similar approach.</p>
      <p>The company has installed a modern effluent treatment plant that converts the distillery effluent into valuable fuel for its boilers. The steam produced from these is fed into a modern turbine to generate valuable clean power. JIL has constructed several rain harvesting trenches throughout its premises for replenishing the natural aquifer and water conservation.</p>
